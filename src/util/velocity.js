/*
*   [ Altitude vs Air Density Third-Order Curve Coefficients ]
*
*   To calculate air density at a given altitude, three range-specific
*   third-order equations are used as an approximation. For a profile `p`
*   and altitude `h`, the corresponding calculation may be found as:
*
*       Density = p[0]*h**3 + p[1]*h**2 + p[2]*h + p[3]
*
*   The following coefficients were calculated in ranges via data from
*   U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976, a summary of which may be found here:
*   https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-atmosphere-d_604.html
